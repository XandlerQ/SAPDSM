The task of analyzing the competition for a resource of two different species is a classic one for
population ecology. A large number of works are devoted to this problem. This report describes an
agent-based simulation model of two populations competing for a single resource. The possibility of
organizing collective interaction within each of the populations is introduced, which allows
populations to increase their competitiveness. The model describes the life cycle of each individual. It
is believed that an individual dies if its mass-energy becomes non-positive. Individuals can form
flocks under certain conditions. In the model, this is formalized through the ability to organize
networks connecting individuals of the same species. At the same time, individuals can form only a
certain number of connections with neighbors. The concept of "valence" is introduced in the model to
describe this. It is assumed that within each network there is an instant redistribution of the resource
available to each member of the pack to all members of the network As a result of the simulation
experiments, the following was discovered. If the resource is highly productive, then in the process of
competitive interaction, the population, agents of which have a higher "valence", wins. And in the case
of a low-productive resource, population of agents with a lower "valence" emerges victorious. That
happens due to the fact that more complex structures require more energy to maintain the flock.
Key words: population, competition, agent simulation model, flock structure.
